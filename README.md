The primary objective of this project was to develop a CNN model to classify whether a subject has a tumor based on an MRI scan.

**What is Brain Tumor?**
A brain tumor occurs when abnormal cells develop in the brain. There are two main types of tumors: cancerous (malignant) tumors and benign tumors. Cancerous tumors can be further divided into primary tumors, which originate in the brain, and secondary tumors, also known as brain metastasis tumors, which spread from other parts of the body.

All types of brain tumors can cause symptoms that vary based on the specific area of the brain affected. Common symptoms include headaches, seizures, vision problems, vomiting, and changes in mental status. Headaches are typically worse in the morning and may improve after vomiting. Other potential symptoms include difficulty walking, speaking, or sensing the environment. As the disease progresses, individuals may experience unconsciousness.

**Data Description ->** The image data that was used for this problem is Brain MRI Images for Brain Tumor Detection. It consists of MRI scans of two classes:

NO - no tumor, encoded as 0
YES - tumor, encoded as 1

Unfortunately, the description of the data set lacks information about the origin of these MRI scans. Some samples of MRI scans with their labels are shown below:
