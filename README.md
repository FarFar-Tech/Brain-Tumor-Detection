The main purpose of this project was to build a CNN model that would classify if subject has a tumor or not base on MRI scan.

**Data Description ->** The image data that was used for this problem is Brain MRI Images for Brain Tumor Detection. It conists of MRI scans of two classes:

NO - no tumor, encoded as 0
YES - tumor, encoded as 1

Unfortunately, the data set description doesn't hold any information where this MRI scans come from and so on.
